# Student Placement Classification

A machine learning project that predicts student placement outcomes based on academic performance, skills, and other relevant factors.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes student data to build a classification model that predicts whether a student will get placed or not. The model uses various features including academic performance, internship experience, communication skills, and more to make accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical variables and class imbalance
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Implements various classification algorithms
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation with confusion matrix and classification reports
- **Visualization**: Clear data visualization and model performance charts
- **Undersampling**: Addresses class imbalance using RandomUnderSampler

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

- **College_ID**: Unique identifier for each student
- **IQ**: Intelligence quotient score
- **Prev_Sem_Result**: Previous semester academic performance
- **CGPA**: Cumulative Grade Point Average
- **Academic_Performance**: Overall academic performance score
- **Internship_Experience**: Whether the student has internship experience
- **Extra_Curricular_Score**: Participation in extracurricular activities
- **Communication_Skills**: Assessment of communication abilities
- **Projects_Completed**: Number of projects completed
- **Placement**: Target variable (Yes/No)
